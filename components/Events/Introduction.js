                The world around us is constantly changing, yet “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever” (Heb. 13:8). As Christians are pushed toward the margins of a hostile society, we cannot afford to surrender our convictions or to retreat in fear. By God’s grace, we have the truth that this lost world needs. Now is our time to stand with unrelenting devotion to God’s unchanging Word.

                Our 2023 National Conference will encourage us to stand firm on the everlasting doctrines of the Christian faith (1 Cor. 16:13). Since the Lord does not change in turbulent times, we must live courageously and without compromise for His eternal truth.
